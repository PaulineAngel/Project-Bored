Im stuck in:
-make a list of types, why:
--because the api doenst have one endpoint for list all
--and a dont get how to make variable type enum 

-make a buton for get a activity by one type X(in test i put 'music'), why:
--i dont know, this fucking thing doesnt work

-create one if for get the activity in 2 ways (which type null and which type X), because, i said before, the api doesnt have one end point for that. why:
--the app broken, and I DONT KNOW WHY
